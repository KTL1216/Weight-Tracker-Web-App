# A Weight Tracker Website Application
- Programmed with JavaScript using Google Apps Script
- Designed the website’s interface using HTML
- Allow user to record user’s height, weight, and name, and store these data in a Google Spreadsheet
- Calculate user’s BMI and generate a tracking table by loading data from the Google Spreadsheet

# Screenshots explaining how the Web App works
User can input their height and weight along with their name to record the data

Then the Web App will output the BMI of most recent input height and weight, and it will add this most recent input into the log that tracks every input

It works by storing all the user inputs into a Google Spreadsheet, and retrieve data from the spreadsheet to calculate BMI and display the log.
